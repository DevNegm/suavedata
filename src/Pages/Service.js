The goal of sentiment modeling is to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as a customer review, social media post, or news article, as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment models are trained on large datasets of annotated text to learn the relationships between words, phrases, and sentiment. The resulting models can then be used to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in new, unseen text data. Sentiment modeling is used in a variety of applications, such as marketing research, customer experience management, and public opinion analysis.",

This can be achieved through a variety of methods, including: Synthetic data creation: This involves generating completely artificial data that mimics real- world data, but with randomized or otherwise fictional values. Sampling from existing data: This involves taking a sample of real-world data and using it to generate new data by making random modifications, such as adding noise or combining data points. Data augmentation: This involves generating new data by transforming existing data, such as rotating an image or adding noise to an audio signal. The generated data can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as testing machine learning models, improving data privacy, or providing additional training data for models.",
